  This is a brief summary of the book "Atatürk's Books on Military Affairs" by Cumali Ordugahı. The book was prepared by a committee headed by Nurer Uğurlu and published by Yenigün News Agency in August 1998.
It is a gift from C newspaper to its readers. Atatürk has stated in a speech that he first loves the artistry of the military. His book "Zabit ve Kumandan ile Hasbihal" best explains his thoughts and reflects his views.
In this book, Atatürk discusses how people should be governed and emphasizes the importance of ideas and those who understand and spread those ideas. He believes that understanding the desires, ideas,
and hidden emotions of the people they will govern is essential. He also emphasizes the need to create a sense of morale and character in the soldiers they will command. Atatürk's ideas on military education underscore
the importance of the army as a school for training and developing soldiers. He highlights the role of officers as not only teachers but also educators who should cultivate the humane and national sentiments already
present in the soldiers. Atatürk sees the military academy as a stepping stone and believes that the real school for an officer is their service in the field. He states that memorizing regulations and rules does not
make an officer competent, but rather, they must possess the ability to act and think creatively. Atatürk regards the commander as the dynamic force, heart, and will of the army. He emphasizes the importance of a 
competent and responsible commander who is knowledgeable, courageous, level-headed, and has a vision for success. Atatürk believes that the commander's ability to give appropriate and implementable orders is crucial 
as even the smallest mistake can lead to the death of thousands. Therefore, the commander should not give orders just for the sake of giving orders; rather, the orders should be necessary and practical.
This passage discusses the importance of giving orders and the process of carrying them out. According to Atatürk, giving orders involves a preparation phase before the order is given and a monitoring phase after the
order is carried out. Atatürk emphasizes the need for thorough examination and consideration before making a decision, as well as the importance of initiative and courage in implementing the order. 
Atatürk also discusses the concept of victory, which he sees as the realization of an idea and the result of collective effort. He highlights the significance of intellect and willpower in achieving victory.
The passage also briefly mentions Atatürk's book "Cumali Ordugahı, Süvari, Bölük, Alay, Liva Talim ve Manevraları," which contains his notes and observations during military exercises and includes critiques from
commanders. Overall, the passage highlights Atatürk's philosophy on leadership, decision-making, and the pursuit of goals.
  
  
  The passage discusses a book written by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, where he includes a conversation with Lieutenant Kemal Efendi about military tactics. Atatürk expresses his satisfaction with Kemal Efendi's views
and thanks him for his insights. The book also includes a military exercise conducted by the Fifth Corps and mentions the duty of the Turkish army to defend the homeland. Atatürk emphasizes the unity and strength
of the Turkish army, stating that it represents the pride and power of the nation. The passage also lists several sources for further reading on Atatürk's speeches and writings.
The passage describes the Cumali Ordugahı, a military camp where military exercises and maneuvers were conducted. The camp was located in Cumali and Karacalı Kariye, 10 kilometers east of Köprülü.
The camp consisted of the 15th cavalry regiment from Köprülü and the 16th cavalry regiment from Katip, with the commander of the 3rd cavalry division, Mirliva Suphi Pasha, leading the training.
On August 16, 1325 (1909), a group of military officials, including Mustafa Kemal, visited the camp to inspect the training. The author, an aide to the Commander of the War Department, also attended the camp until
August 26. The author notes that it was rare for a cavalry division to gather for training purposes. The author decided to share his notes as a gift to his comrades to commemorate his time at the camp. The passage also provides a brief description of the first training session that took place, including instructions given by the regiment commander about practicing combat and pursuit maneuvers. The passage ends with a mention of the enemy forces approaching and causing significant casualties among our troops.
The commander of the reconnaissance unit had previously instructed your platoon to go to the left flank of the infantry hunter line and target the neighborhood in the valley. However, due to rain, the road was
disrupted, so to save time, the commander of the reconnaissance unit ordered your platoon to attack the enemy by passing through the intervals of the infantry hunter line. The platoon followed hidden paths until it
reached its destination. The platoon then moved towards the rear of the infantry hunter line, turned left, and attacked the enemy. The battalion commander praised the platoon commander's quick response and
decision-making. In another situation, a platoon was ordered to secure certain ridges. The platoon was to advance and maintain the ridge until further notice. The platoon received information that an enemy unit was approaching, and the platoon commander decided to engage the enemy on foot. The battalion commander approved of this decision and advised the platoon to continuously advance as much as possible to engage the enemy from a distance. The platoon successfully secured the ridge and maintained their position while engaging the enemy. The battalion commander praised the platoon commander for selecting a suitable position and effectively engaging the enemy.
  
  
  In summary, the passage describes a military exercise involving different units. The commander sends cavalry scouts to gather information about the enemy's movements and positions. The troops are then repositioned
and a plan is made to attack the enemy's flank. The commander utilizes the terrain and the enemy's confusion to successfully carry out the attack.
